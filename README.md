Build-DSA

Build-DSA is my structured and disciplined journey to master Data Structures & Algorithms from the ground up.

This repository is not about solving random problems. It’s about building strong fundamentals, learning how to think logically, and developing the ability to break down problems before touching code.

What this repository focuses on

Step-by-step learning of core DSA concepts

Logic-first problem solving, not memorization

Clean and readable implementations

Daily consistency over last-minute cramming

How I learn here

Understand the concept deeply

Write solutions in my own words and logic

Track progress honestly, including mistakes

Improve clarity, efficiency, and confidence

Goal

To build solid DSA foundations, sharpen problem-solving skills, and be well-prepared for technical interviews.

No shortcuts. No copy-paste.
Just Build DSA, the right way.
